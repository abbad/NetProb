UDP and TCP clients and servers using python and c
--------------------------------------------------
- Very simple applications explaining the concepts of socket programming in c and python. 

- C source code needs to be compiled before running.

- Python code run without compile (python 2.7 needed). 

- Size of packet can be defined in UDPClient.py warning your computer might beep sometimes 
  because of the random generation of bytes. 

- for now there is no exception handling for the python application. 

- c will be excluded from the project.
